    This was a vision-based approach to developing a tic-tac-toe playing robot using \textit{Arduino, Android, and OpenCV}.
    The robot operates via the help of an attached mobile phone which identifies the board configuration
    and calculates the next move by applying the minimax algorithm.\\
    In this project, I was in charge of developing the mobile app and I had to create an Android application
    using OpenCV Android SDK to process the camera feed and inform the next move to the micro-controller via Bluetooth. \par

    {\bf Open Inventory | Inventory Management System}     \hfill {\em February 2020 - June 2020}
    \\ \lightsubtitle{\url{https://github.com/openinventoryorg}}\\
